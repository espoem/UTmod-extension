# UTmod

UTmod is a Chrome browser extension to make a life of a Utopian reviewer easier. Its aim is to gather important tools to one place so that a reviewer does not need to go to several locations.

## Install

The extension is under development and is not finalized. Therefore, it has not been published in the Chrome Store. You can install it locally, however.

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Node.js
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run release` to build minified version of the code
5. Navigate to chrome://extensions/, activate developer mode, click "load unpacked" and select the `dist/` folder
